       " {'review': 'works really well. More versatile than standard USB-C cables as these can be plugged into the more common USB \"A\" found on computers and most phone chargers.  This eliminates the need for me to carry a separate USB-C charger when travelling.NOTE that it will not charge as quickly as a standard USB-C charger with a USB-C cable, but charges quickly enough.Using the \"AMPERE\" phone app, the attached pics show that the AMPERE app measuring the charging of an ALMOST fully charged LG Nexus 5X phone charging at the max rate of 400 mAh with the LG Charger and OEM LG USB-C cable.The other picture showing the max charging rate of 340 mAh is with the Amazon USB-A=> USB-C and a OLYTEK travel charging using the standard USB-A outlet.  So, the AMAZON cable is charging about 85% as quickly as the OEM LG USB-c charger and cable.NOTE 2= when a phone is mostly charged, the charging rate slows down.  If the phone\\'s battery was used up the rates would be much higher.Seems to be of very high quality and the white cables make them easy to locate in a bag.',\n",

       " {'review': 'Not the best of the Amazonbasics cables i\\'ve used.  Bought it as a secondary cable for use in my car.  Whenever I plug it into my cell phone (ZTE MAX) the phone continually \"dings\" on and off because the cable is very loose in the USB C port.  The OEM cable does not cause this to happen, neither does the OEM cable from a Samsung phone I have.I  have several of this brand of charger cable for my Apple products, both with the 30 pin connector and the lightning connector, and always recommend them over any other brand including Apple\\'s branded cables, as these have worked just as good for a fraction of the price, and honestly, have lasted longer than the Apple OEM ones. Which makes me think that this is just an isolated issue.I did not return it because if I use it as a desktop charger, where it\\'s not moving in the vehicle, it does not chime on and off all to often.  I assuming that its because it\\'s stationary and the plug is not wiggling around.I would still recommend buying Amazonbasics cables over the OEM for any manufacturer, and especially over the 100\\'s of non OEM brands from any retailer, as they not only cost more, but in my experciance are subpar, and not orth buying even at 1/2 the cost of the Amazon basics.',\n",

       " {'review': 'The description says it will work with “any Type-C enabled device”. Maybe I’m just misunderstanding what “any Type-C enabled device” actually is. I would like a longer charging cable for my iPad Pro and I gambled, since it says it will work with another Apple product, (the MacBook), and lost. The cable might just as well be a piece of string with usb plugs. There is no response of any kind when I plug it in. Even an off brand lightning cable will say “this device may not work with this cable “. Returning it would just be more trouble than it’s worth. Giving it two stars is working on the assumption that it may actually work on “any Type-C enabled device”... except the iPad Pro! So, be careful and don’t get your hopes up. Especially if you want to use it for an Apple product.To be fair I could not find anywhere it said it WOULD work with the iPad Pro. 🌟🌟UPDATE: I does work! The charging cable that came with the iPad is instantly recognized so when I plugged the new one in and it didn’t immediately work I made the mistaken assumption that my new iPad just wouldn’t recognize this Non-Apple cord. It actually takes about 7-8 seconds to wake up and begin charging with this generic cable.So, 7 seconds is just fine with me and assuming it won’t burn out like the old Lightning cables did.I couldn’t be happier.If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!',\n",
